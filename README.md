# PentaSynth

Welcome to the repository for the website of PentaSynth Pvt. Ltd. This API is built using Node.js and Express.js.

# Folder Structure

1. index.js: This is your entry point. It should initialize the Express app and can be used to import routes, middleware, and start the server.
2. Routes Directory: Create a folder named routes. Inside, you can have different files for each set of routes (e.g., userRoutes.js, productRoutes.js). This helps in separating the routing logic for different parts of your application.

3. Controllers Directory: Create a controllers folder. Controllers will contain the logic for handling requests that come into your routes. Each controller should correspond to a route.

4. Models Directory: If you're using a database, create a models directory. This will contain the schema definitions for your database models (e.g., User, Product).

5. Middleware Directory: Create a middleware folder for custom middleware functions, such as authentication checks, logging, error handling, etc.

6. Utilities or Helpers Directory: For utility functions or helper scripts which are reused in multiple places in the application.

7. Config Directory: A config folder can be used to store configuration files, such as database configuration, environment-specific settings (development, production), etc.

8. Public Directory: If your server is serving static files (images, stylesheets, scripts), these can be placed in a public folder.

9. Views Directory: If you are using a templating engine with Express (like EJS, Pug), you might have a views folder for your templates.
